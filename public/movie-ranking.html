    <h1>The Best Movies According to Amo</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>The Nun</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite horror movie. It's unpredictable and I love it for that very reason.</p>
    <h3>Land of Bad</h3>
    <p>It has a unique plot, there's a lot of suspense and twists that keep you engaged.</p>
    <h3>Three Idiots</h3>
    <p>It's very funny, and with lots of valuable lessons.</p>
