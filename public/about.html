  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Amos and I am a web developer. Although my first undergraduate degree isn't related to IT or programming in any way, I've always wanted to be a software engineer.
  I'm not there yet, but web development is, I believe my first step towards realizing my goal.
  I've fallen off the path quite a few times, but this time, I'm proud to say I've stuck on and I'm well on my way to become a skilled developer who can deliver the best outcomes for his clients and employers.
</p>

<p>I'm grateful for IBM's assistance without which I don't think any of these would've been possible. The IBM Skillsbuild frontend development program has played a pivotal role in helping me understand the role of a web developer. Through the program I've also been able to access up to date and structured training.
  If you're looking for a developer for your next project or job, you can always count on me </p>
